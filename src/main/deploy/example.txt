Files placed in this directory will be deployed to the RoboRIO into the
  'deploy' directory in the home folder. Use the 'frc::filesystem::GetDeployDirectory'
  function from the 'frc/Filesystem.h' header to get a proper path relative to the deploy
  directory.

  I think what this means is for scripted files like xml or lua, it looks like they have a 
  standardized work-flow of where to put these and standardized way to find them in the code
  which reads them.  (Hopefully the simulation can work with as well).
